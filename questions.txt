I'm really stumped on sorting by state name when rates are tied.

I know there have been a few hints, but I can't make sense of them.

I'm stumped on the approach to take:

1. Should I finish sorting by rate, then iterate through all the rows, somehow isolate the rows with rate ties and somehow sort the state names in just those rows?

2. Or should I be handling the rate ties as I'm sorting the rate column?

It seems I would need to spot a tie in rates, then somehow sort a[1] and b[1] before sort a[2] and b[2].
