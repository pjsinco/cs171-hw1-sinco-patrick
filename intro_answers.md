**1.** There are a few ways:

* Make the table sortable by the "Rate" column. 
* Highlight the min and max unemployments rates in the table, with color or a bold font weight. This is a better at-a-glance solution.
* A tooltip could also be a good way to provide summary stats. For instance, mousing over a column header could provide that column's mean, median, max and min values.
* Another summary-stat tooltip possibility is, when mousing over a cell, showing the column's distribution or histogram and highlighting where in it that particular value falls. That could be an option the user could switch on and off.

Its [data binding](http://10rempatrick.com/images/ct-biz-0418-wrigley-history-a-jpg-20130417.jpg) is quite unlike D3's.
