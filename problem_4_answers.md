**1.** The upper end of the domain--the highest number we expect to see in our data--will be equal to one less than the number of rows in our dataset 

**2.** The function returns the color value that corresponds to the passed value in our scale. So our output range is between orange-red and slver; passing a value to the color() function returns the corresponding color value in our scale. 

**3.** Instead of mapping values between 0 and 50, the scale would map values between 2.6 and 9.0. We would want to use rate values for the scale if we were operating on the rate values in our visualization.
