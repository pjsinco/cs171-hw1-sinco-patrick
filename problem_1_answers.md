  The DOM inspector is interactive, making it much easier to match an element with its style. Also, I can change the values in the DOM inspector and see of the changes affect the page. The DOM inspector is also formatted more nicely, with proper indents for nested elements, unlike the HTML source code page. Last, the DOM inspector shows the results of my javascript DOM element injections; the HTML source page does not include my made-on-the-fly elements.

  The HTML source page is useful because all the markup is fully laid out in front of me. I don't have to click on any triangles to reveal HTML elements. Also, the source code is immediately available in a full page. It's not cramped into only a portion of the screen like the DOM inspector.
